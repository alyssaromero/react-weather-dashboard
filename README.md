### Summary
I created this dashboard in order to learn the basics of ReactJS and to improve my existing frontend development skills. The project utlizes the DarkSky API for gathering weather data based on current location, OpenCage API for forward/reverse Geocoding for searching weather in other locations, as well as basic styling with CSS/SASS.
